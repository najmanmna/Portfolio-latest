## 🏥 About the Client

Patients Helping Hands (PHH) is a student-operated NGO based in Karachi, working selflessly for patients in hospitals like NICH, NICVD, and JPMC. With growing outreach and impactful community work, PHH needed a clean, professional online presence to showcase their mission, projects, and enable donation transparency.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To design and develop a modern, responsive, and minimal website that reflected PHH’s vision of compassion, service, and professionalism — while maintaining a subtle, non-commercial look that aligned with their medical and humanitarian identity.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

- Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer
- Collaborated closely with PHH’s executive board
- Took lead on design decisions, implementation, and animation flow

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **React.js** for interactive UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion & GSAP** for subtle scroll-based animations
- **Lottie Files** for custom preloader animation
- **Figma** for homepage layout prototyping

---

## 🧠 UX Approach

Since PHH wanted a subtle, professional look, I prioritized:

- Clear section hierarchy with well-spaced content blocks
- Minimal animations to maintain a calm and non-distracting user experience
- Easy navigation with a responsive navbar and fixed CTA buttons
- Designing for both mobile and desktop accessibility

### 🌈 Special Touch

A custom preloader animation was developed using Lottie, symbolizing care and patience — which truly impressed the PHH team and set the tone for the rest of the site.
